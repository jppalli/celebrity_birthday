This module contains the Lua scripts for feedback mode, a new feature utilizing the DataModelCapture service.
The module itself is only used while in feedback mode, and the mode has an entry point via the standard settings menu flow.
While in feedback mode, the original client DataModel continues in the background as usual, while a second frozen DataModel in which the client can select elements to leave translation feedback on is rendered.  
They can exit the mode and return to gameplay via a button on the menu.

This module is currently slated for soothsayer release!
There are a few changes on the log for full release, for example:
